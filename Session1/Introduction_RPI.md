## <a name="rpi1"></a> What is a Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is a small computer of the size of a credit card that you can plug in a TV/monitor, keyboard and mouse. You can use it in the same way as you desktop PC or laptop does, like generating spreadsheets, word processing, browsing the internet, and playing games. It also plays high-definition video. However, what does more interesting Raspberry Pi (RPi), is the capability to make electronics projects with it! The main aim of RPI's design is to teach young people to program and to create new ideas. It has a free licence Linux operative system hold in an SD card and powered by a USB phone charger.

## <a name="rpi2"></a> Models of Raspberry Pi

There are different models of Raspberry Pi.

### Important

* Always make sure you supply only 5 V to the RPi.
* Unlike Arduino, RPi does not have over-voltage protection on the board (yet) as Arduino, be careful when making GPIO connections.
* Please DO NOT connect over 3.3V  or less than + 0V as input.
* Never demand that any output pin source or sink more than 16 mA.
* Pins can supply only maximum 50 mA.


## <a name="rpi4"></a> Why Raspberry Pi?

Why we chose RPI? When you compare RPI with Arduino, at first instance you can think that RPI is just faster and better and superior (Better processor and RAM memory). However,  Arduino, even though is older,  is well suited to certain tasks. Therefore, I would not say RPi is superior to Arduino or Arduino is superior to RPi. It just depends on what you want to use them. They are different and suitable for various aims.

Another main difference between RPI and Arduino is that RPI has an operative system, whereas Arduino has not. The latter, you can run the code and run directly on the microcontroller. The presence of an operative system, make all the precess slower since the application does not directly interact with the microcontroller. What it means is that the application can not change a pin directly (turn from high to low or low to high), it has to go through the operative system. But there are many advantages of having an operative system.

The first thing you get is really a user interface. Arduino does not have a real user interface. It means that can do too much with it unless you write a program telling how to manipulate the pins, and may be is going to do something. In the case of having an operative system as in PRI, you can perform different tasks at the same time (multitasking); send and email, browsing the internet, coding and run the code to control the pins. We will see more about the RPI-Linux operating system with more detail in a bit.

## <a name="rpi5"></a> Is RPi an IoT device?

First, what is an IoT?

It is the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.

* **May be—** Depends on how it is used.
* **Similarities**
  * Network connectivity and computational processing power.
  * Small and cheap (relative to a PC)
  * Can interface directly with sensors and actuators via pins.
  * The complexity of the system is not visible (interact via buttons, web apps).
* **Differences**
  * Interface can be exactly the same as a PC with Linux.
  * The complexity of the system is visible.

After all the things we have learn about RPi, we can ask if you consider a Raspberry Pi to be an Internet of Things device? The answer is depending on how the RPI is being used.  If you use the RPi like a laptop or desktop, meaning you are interacting with it by using the keyboard, a mouse, and a screen you are not using it as an IoT device. But you can also use it in such a way where you are not interacting with it directly. You can connect a bunch of sensors or actuators employing the pins, and rather type text directly with the keyboard into the RPi you just interact with the sensors or actuators by pushing buttons that make the actuators to do something. Then, you are are using the RPi as an IoT device because you are not directly interacting with the processor. Instead, you are communicating with the sensors and actuators.

## <a name="rpi6"></a> General Purpose I/O Pins (GPIO)


Your Raspberry Pi is more than just a small computer; it is a hardware prototyping tool! The RPi has **bi-directional I/O pins**, which you can use to drive LEDs, spin motors, or read button presses. To drive the RPi's I/O lines requires a bit or programming. You can use a [variety of programming languages](http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#GPIO_Code_examples), but we decided to use a reliable, easy tools for driving I/O: **Python**.

###  GPIO Pinout

Raspberry has its GPIO over a standard male header on the board. From the first models to the latest, the header has expanded from 26 pins to 40 pins while maintaining the original pinout.

<p align="center">
<img src="rpi_old_new_pin.jpg" alt="rpi" width="500">
</p>

There are (at least) two, different numbering schemes you may encounter when referencing **Pi pin numbers**:

1. **Broadcom (SoC) chip-specific** pin numbers.
2. **P1 physical** pin numbers.

You can use either number-system, but when you are programming how to use the pins, it requires that you declare which scheme you are using at the very beginning of your program. We will see this later.

The next table shows all 40 pins on the P1 header, including any particular function they may have, and their dual numbers:

<p align="center">
<img src="header_pinout.jpg" alt="pin" width="500">
</p>

In the next table, we show another numbering system along with the ones we showed above: **Pi pin header numbers and element14 given names, wiringPi numbers, Python numbers, and related silkscreen on the wedge**. The Broadcom pin numbers in the table are related to RPi Model 2 and later only.

<p align="center">

</p>

This table shows that the RPi not only gives you access to the bi-directional I/O pins, but also [Serial (UART)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication), [I2C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c), [SPI](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi), and even some Pulse width modulation ([PWM](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation) — “analog output”).


## <a name="rpi7"></a> Digital and Analog

RPI has just digital I/O (not analogue). GPIO outputs are easy; they are on or off, HIGH or LOW, 3v or 0v. But let us revise what is the difference between **analogue** and **digital** signals.

Both are used to transmit information, usually through **electric signals**. In both these technologies, the information, such as any audio or video, is transformed into electrical signals. The **difference between analogue and digital**:

* In **analogue technology** (continue signal), information is translated into electric pulses of varying amplitude.

* In **digital technology** (discrete signal), translation of information is into binary format (zero or one) where each bit is representative of two distinct amplitudes.

<p align="center">
<img src="analog_digital.png" alt="pin" width="500">
</p>

To make an analogy for analogue and digital, you can think of a typical light switch versus a dimmer switch. Digital is like the switch on the left of the figure bellow; it can be either on or off (binary state). analogue, on the other hand, can be set at a range of values between fully on and completely off.

## <a name="rpi8"></a> Output: Converting Digital to Analogue

In the most recent versions of Raspbian Linux (RPI operative system), the **GPIO Python module** already installed, which has experimental functions for controlling the GPIO pins, sort of like a dimmer switch.
This module is “sort of” like a dimmer switch because the module uses a method called **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**, to make it seem like there is a range of voltages coming out of its outputs. What it is doing is pulsing its pins on and off really quickly. So if you want the pin to be as though it is at half voltage, the pin will be pulsed so that it is on 50% of the time and on for 50% of the time. If you want the pin to be as though it is at 20% power, it will turn the pin on 20% of the time and off  80% of the time. **The percentage of time that it is on versus total time of the cycle is called the duty cycle** (See figure bellow). When you connect a LED to these pins and instruct the Raspberry Pi to change the duty cycle, it can give the effect of dimming the LED.

<p align="center">

The duty cycle represents how much time the pin is turned on over the course of an on-off cycle<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>.
